Welcome to our repository for our HackDuke2020 project! Weâ€™ve created a website that contains a broad range of information about the COVID-19, including latest updates, forecast for daily new cases, interactive visualization, and more. Check it out at https://hackduke2020.github.io/

In particular, we would like to mention that, our website has a page dedicated to COVID-19 news closely related to college communities in the US (https://hackduke2020.github.io/components/news.html). Given the mode of learning and living in college communities, they are especially likely to be hit hard by outbreaks if safety measures are not sufficiently implemented. As a group of college freshmen at Duke University, we are well aware of such risks and very grateful for everyone who has contributed to making Duke open and safe for the entire Fall 2020 semester, and meanwhile, we would like to offer more useful information about COVID situation in college communities nationwide on our website to keep you updated and well-informed.
